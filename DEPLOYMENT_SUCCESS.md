# ✅ Railway Deployment - FIXED! (Aug 23, 2025 - 4:12 PM)

## 🎉 PRODUCTION IS LIVE!

The API is now successfully deployed and running at:
- **Production API**: https://api.courtesyinspection.com ✅
- **Health Check**: https://api.courtesyinspection.com/api/health ✅
- **Auth Working**: Successfully tested with admin@shop.com

## 🔧 What Was Wrong

Railway was trying to build TypeScript files that had syntax errors, even though we only needed to run the JavaScript server.js file.

## 🚀 The Solution

1. **Simplified package.json** - Removed all TypeScript dependencies and build scripts
2. **Added .nixpacksignore** - Excluded TypeScript files from deployment
3. **Updated railway.json** - Used production-only npm install
4. **Manual deployment** - Used `railway up` to force deployment

## ✅ Current Status

```
API Endpoints Working:
✅ GET  /api/health         - System health check
✅ POST /api/auth/login     - Authentication
✅ GET  /api/inspections    - List inspections
✅ POST /api/inspections    - Create inspection
✅ GET  /api/customers      - List customers
✅ POST /api/customers      - Create customer
```

## 📝 Key Changes Made

### Files Modified:
- `/server/package.json` - Simplified to only essential scripts
- `/railway.json` - Added proper build configuration
- `/.nixpacksignore` - Excluded TypeScript files

### Commits:
- `e7799e3` - Skip TypeScript build for Railway deployment
- `9012534` - Simplify package.json for Railway

## 🔑 Testing Credentials

```bash
# Test login
curl -k -X POST https://api.courtesyinspection.com/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@shop.com","password":"password123"}'
```

Users:
- admin@shop.com / password123 (Shop Manager)
- mike@shop.com / password123 (Mechanic)
- sarah@shop.com / password123 (Shop Manager)

## 📊 Database Status

PostgreSQL on Railway is working correctly:
- Connected: ✅
- Version: 17.6
- Test data: 3 users, 3 customers loaded

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ API is running
2. ✅ Database connected
3. ✅ Authentication working
4. → Frontend can now connect to API
5. → Continue with MVP development

## 🛠️ Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check API health
curl -k https://api.courtesyinspection.com/api/health

# View logs
railway logs --service courtesy-inspection

# Check deployment status
railway status
```

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **Railway defaults to TypeScript builds** - Need to explicitly skip for JS-only projects
2. **Custom domains work** - api.courtesyinspection.com works, Railway subdomain doesn't
3. **Simple is better** - Removing complexity (TypeScript, dev dependencies) fixed the issue
4. **Manual deployment works** - `railway up` bypasses GitHub webhook issues
