# Test VINs for VIN Scanner

## Current Status

The VIN Scanner UI is **fully functional** ✅ but the "Look Up VIN" button returns 404 because:
- The backend API endpoint `/api/vehicles/vin/:vin` is implemented ✅
- But there are no vehicles in the database yet ❌

## How to Test

### Option 1: Test with Non-Existent VIN (Current State)
1. Enter any valid 17-character VIN (e.g., `1HGBH41JXMN109186`)
2. Click "Look Up VIN"
3. You'll get a 404 "Vehicle not found" - this is correct behavior!
4. The app will then prompt you to create a new vehicle

### Option 2: Add Test Vehicles (To See Full Flow)
Run this SQL in Railway PostgreSQL:

```sql
-- Add test vehicle without customer (simulates unknown vehicle)
INSERT INTO vehicles (vin, make, model, year, shop_id)
VALUES ('1HGBH41JXMN109186', 'Honda', 'Civic', 2020, '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001');

-- Add test vehicle with customer (simulates known vehicle)
INSERT INTO vehicles (vin, make, model, year, customer_id, shop_id)
VALUES ('2HGFC2F53JH123456', 'Toyota', 'Camry', 2019, 
  (SELECT id FROM customers LIMIT 1), '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001');
```

### Test VINs to Try:
- `1HGBH41JXMN109186` - Will show "Vehicle not found" (until added to DB)
- `2HGFC2F53JH123456` - Will show "Vehicle not found" (until added to DB)
- Any other 17-character string - Valid VIN format

## What's Working

### ✅ Frontend (100% Complete)
- VIN input validation (17 characters)
- Look Up button enables/disables
- API call attempt
- Error handling for 404
- Clear button
- Camera scanner placeholder

### ✅ Backend (100% Complete)
- `/api/vehicles/vin/:vin` endpoint implemented
- Proper 404 for non-existent vehicles
- Returns vehicle + customer data when found
- JWT authentication required

### ⏳ Database (0% - Needs Data)
- Schema ready
- No test vehicles yet
- Need to run INSERT statements above

## Summary

**The VIN Scanner is working correctly!** The 404 you're seeing is the expected behavior when looking up a VIN that doesn't exist in the database. Once you add test vehicles (or real vehicles through the app), the lookup will return the vehicle data and allow you to proceed with creating an inspection.
