### Backup & Recovery
- [ ] **Data Protection**
  - [ ] Implement database backup strategy
  - [ ] Test backup restoration process
  - [ ] Document recovery procedures
  - [ ] Implement soft deletes for critical data
  - [ ] Create data retention policies

## üü¢ NICE-TO-HAVE IMPROVEMENTS

### Documentation
- [ ] API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] Deployment runbook
- [ ] Security incident response plan
- [ ] Performance baseline documentation
