# 🚨 Courtesy Inspection - CRITICAL STATE (Aug 23, 2025 - 11:45 AM)

## 🔴 EMERGENCY STATUS: Production Down, Local Working

### Current Deployment Crisis
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  app.courtesyinspection.com │────▶│  api.courtesyinspection.com │
│  (Frontend - Not Deployed)  │     │  (Backend - NOT RUNNING)    │
└─────────────────────────────┘     └─────────────────────────────┘
         Railway Service:                    Railway Service:
        courtesy-frontend                  courtesy-inspection
        ❌ Deploy Failed                   ❌ Deploy Failed
```

## 🎯 THE PROBLEM

**Railway is returning its own 404 error**: `{"status":"error","code":404,"message":"Application not found"}`
- This means NO version of our app is running
- Both services show "Deploy failed" in Railway dashboard
- The code works PERFECTLY locally on port 8847

## ✅ What's Working

### Local Development (Port 8847)
```bash
# Server running perfectly
cd /Users/mre/Documents/gits/courtesy-inspection/server
PORT=8847 npm run dev:local

# All endpoints functional:
✅ GET /api/health
✅ POST /api/auth/login
✅ GET /api/inspections
✅ GET /api/inspections/shop/:shopId  # Frontend needs this!
✅ POST /api/inspections
✅ GET/POST /api/customers
✅ GET /api/customers/search
```

### Database
- PostgreSQL on Railway: **WORKING**
- Connection string in server/.env
- Test data loaded
- 3 test users, 2 inspections created

## ❌ What's NOT Working

### Production Deployment
- api.courtesyinspection.com → Railway 404 (app not found)
- courtesy-inspection-production.up.railway.app → Same 404
- Frontend can't access any API endpoints
- Railway not picking up GitHub pushes

## 📝 What We've Tried

### Attempt 1: Complex railway.toml (FAILED)
```toml
# Tried to build both frontend and backend
buildCommand = "if [ \"$RAILWAY_SERVICE_NAME\" = \"courtesy-frontend\" ]; then cd app && npm ci && npm run build:web; else cd server && npm ci; fi"
```
**Result**: Service name mismatch, build failures

### Attempt 2: Simplified railway.toml (FAILED)
```toml
# Current configuration - committed but not deploying
[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"
buildCommand = "cd server && npm ci"

[deploy]
startCommand = "cd server && node server.js"
```
**Result**: Pushed to GitHub (commit 01dd4b5) but Railway still failing

### Attempt 3: Manual Railway Deployment (NOT YET TRIED)
```bash
railway up --service courtesy-inspection
```

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Option 1: Force Manual Deployment
```bash
cd /Users/mre/Documents/gits/courtesy-inspection/server
railway login
railway link
railway up --service courtesy-inspection

# If that fails, try:
railway up  # Without service flag
```

### Option 2: Create New Railway Service
```bash
cd /Users/mre/Documents/gits/courtesy-inspection/server
railway init  # Create new service
railway up    # Deploy to new service
# Update DNS to point to new service
```

### Option 3: Deploy to Alternative Platform
**Render.com** (Immediate alternative):
1. Sign up at render.com
2. Connect GitHub: MrE-scrum-master/courtesy-inspection
3. Root directory: `server`
4. Build command: `npm ci`
5. Start command: `node server.js`
6. Add env vars: DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, CORS_ORIGINS

## 📂 Code Status

### Server Implementation (100% Complete)
Location: `/server/server.js`
- ✅ Full inspection CRUD
- ✅ Shop-specific endpoints
- ✅ Customer management
- ✅ Authentication with JWT
- ✅ File uploads
- ✅ CORS configured

### Key Files Modified This Session
```
/server/server.js           # Added shop-specific endpoints and customers
/railway.toml              # Simplified to backend-only deployment
/app/package-lock.json     # Fixed dependency issues
```

### Git Status
```bash
Branch: main
Last Commit: 01dd4b5 - "EMERGENCY FIX: Simplify Railway deployment to backend only"
Uncommitted: .DS_Store files, STATE.md, FEATURES.md
```

## 🎬 Session Resume Commands

To continue in next session:
```bash
# 1. Start local server to verify everything works
cd /Users/mre/Documents/gits/courtesy-inspection/server
PORT=8847 npm run dev:local

# 2. Check Railway deployment status
railway status
railway logs --service courtesy-inspection

# 3. If still broken, force deployment
railway up --service courtesy-inspection

# 4. Test production
curl https://api.courtesyinspection.com/api/health
```

## 💡 SuperClaude Context

### Session Configuration
- Working Directory: `/Users/mre/Documents/gits/courtesy-inspection`
- Primary Issue: Railway deployment failures
- Solution Ready: Code is 100% working, just needs deployment

### Next Session Opening
```
/sc:load @STATE.md --wave-mode --persona-devops --seq --validate
"Railway deployments failing. Both services down. Need to get api.courtesyinspection.com running with the shop-specific endpoints the frontend needs."
```

### Active Modes Used
- `--ultrathink` for deep analysis
- `--wave-mode` for systematic investigation
- `--delegate` for parallel processing
- `--persona-architect` and `--persona-devops`
- `--all-mcp` for comprehensive tool usage

## 🔥 CRITICAL SUMMARY

**THE CODE WORKS. RAILWAY WON'T DEPLOY IT.**

Everything is implemented and tested locally. The only problem is Railway refuses to run the application. The solution is either:
1. Force Railway to deploy manually
2. Create a new Railway service
3. Use an alternative platform (Render.com)

The frontend at app.courtesyinspection.com is waiting for these endpoints to work. Once the API is deployed, everything will function.
