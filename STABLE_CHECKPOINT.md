## What's Working
- âœ… Production API: https://api.courtesyinspection.com
- âœ… Production App: https://app.courtesyinspection.com  
- âœ… Authentication with test users
- âœ… All 21 tests passing
- âœ… Database connections stable
- âœ… Railway deployments working

## Test Credentials
```
Email: admin@shop.com
Password: password123
```

## Improvements in This Version
1. **Configuration Consolidated**: Single source of truth (`/server/config.js`)
2. **Tests Added**: 21 critical path tests (auth + API)
3. **JavaScript Standardized**: Backend is pure JS (no TS confusion)
4. **Tech Debt Reduced**: From 6/10 to 3/10

## Key Files Changed
- `/server/config.js` - Centralized configuration
- `/server/tests/auth.test.js` - Authentication tests
- `/server/tests/api.test.js` - API endpoint tests
- `/server/server.js` - Updated to use config module
- `/app/src/config/environment.ts` - Simplified config

## Deployment Commands
```bash
# Backend
cd server
railway up --service courtesy-inspection

# Frontend
cd app
npm run build:web
cp -r web-build/* ../server/public/
cd ../server
railway up --service courtesy-inspection
```

## Run Tests
```bash
cd server
npm test
# Should see: Tests: 21 passed, 21 total
```

## Why This is a Good Checkpoint
- Production is stable and working
- Technical debt significantly reduced
- Test coverage established
- Configuration simplified
- Easy to deploy and maintain

## Next Development
When continuing feature development:
1. Branch from this tag: `git checkout -b feature/new-feature v1.0-stable-tech-debt-reduced`
2. If things go wrong: `git checkout v1.0-stable-tech-debt-reduced`
3. This is your "known good" fallback position

**Remember**: This checkpoint represents a clean, tested, working state with reduced technical debt. It's an excellent foundation for future development!
