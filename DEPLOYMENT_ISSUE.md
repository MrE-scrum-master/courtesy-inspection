# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Railway Deployment Issue - Quick Reference

## THE PROBLEM IN 10 SECONDS
Railway shows "Deploy failed" for both services. The API returns Railway's 404 error (not our app). Code works perfectly locally. Railway is NOT running our application at all.

## FASTEST FIX (Try These In Order)

### 1. Manual Deploy (2 minutes)
```bash
cd /Users/mre/Documents/gits/courtesy-inspection/server
railway up --service courtesy-inspection
```

### 2. New Service (5 minutes)
```bash
cd /Users/mre/Documents/gits/courtesy-inspection/server
railway init  # Create new service
railway up
```

### 3. Alternative Platform (10 minutes)
Go to render.com â†’ Connect GitHub â†’ Point to `/server` â†’ Deploy

## TEST IF FIXED
```bash
curl https://api.courtesyinspection.com/api/health
# Should return JSON with "status": "healthy"
```

## WHAT'S ALREADY DONE
âœ… Code has all endpoints working
âœ… Simplified railway.toml to backend-only
âœ… Pushed to GitHub (commit 01dd4b5)
âœ… Database is running and connected

## WHAT'S NEEDED
Just need Railway to actually RUN the server.js file!

If Railway won't cooperate after 15 minutes, use Render.com. The code is ready.
