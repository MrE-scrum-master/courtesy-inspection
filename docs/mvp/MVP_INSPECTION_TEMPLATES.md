# MVP Inspection Templates Specification

## Overview

**Vehicle-Type Adaptive Inspection System** - Standardized templates that automatically adapt based on VIN-decoded vehicle characteristics. Single system with consistent branding (shop logo/name only).

**Core Principle**: Universal base + vehicle-specific additions = comprehensive yet efficient inspection

**Target Metrics**:
- 30-minute completion time
- Voice-first "co-pilot" interaction
- Revenue opportunity identification
- Simple pass/fail assessment criteria

## VIN Decoder Logic

### Vehicle Classification Matrix

```yaml
vin_decoding:
  fuel_type:
    gas: "characters 4-8 engine codes"
    diesel: "characters 4-8 engine codes" 
    electric: "characters 4-8 engine codes (BEV indicators)"
    hybrid: "characters 4-8 engine codes (HEV/PHEV indicators)"
    
  drivetrain:
    fwd: "character 7 drivetrain code"
    rwd: "character 7 drivetrain code"
    awd: "character 7 drivetrain code"
    4wd: "character 7 drivetrain code"
    
  vehicle_class:
    passenger: "character 4 vehicle type"
    light_truck: "character 4 vehicle type"
    commercial: "character 4 vehicle type"
```

### Template Selection Algorithm

```
1. Decode VIN â†’ Extract fuel_type + drivetrain + vehicle_class
2. Load universal_items (all vehicles get these)
3. Add fuel_type_specific items
4. Add drivetrain_specific items
5. Calculate total_estimated_time
6. Generate voice_command_vocabulary
```
